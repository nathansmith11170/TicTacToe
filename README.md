This is a simple TicTacToe game that plays an optimal game against the player
using the minimax algorithm.

If the human plays optimally, every game will be a tie.

The prototype source files are tests for several procedures, such as checking
the grid or choosing the next move.

Libraries used in this project are SDL2, SDL2_gfx
